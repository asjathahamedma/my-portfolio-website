# üß† Reverse Engineering Challenge - Base64 & XOR

In this beginner-level CTF challenge, the goal was to find the correct password for a 64-bit ELF binary using reverse engineering.

---

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Initial Analysis

Running the binary simply prompted for a password and exited if the input was incorrect.

```bash
$ ./challenge
Enter password:
```

Opening the binary in Ghidra, the password check function revealed two important steps:

- A Base64 encoded string
- XOR logic using a static key `0x13`

> **Note:** The XOR key was hardcoded in the decompiled function.

## üß† Solution Strategy

To solve the challenge, we had to:

- Extract and decode the Base64-encoded string from the binary.
- Reverse the XOR transformation using the known static key.

## üß™ Decode + XOR Script

Here‚Äôs the Python script used to solve it:

```python
import base64

# Encoded string from binary
encoded = base64.b64decode("SGVsbG8gQ1RGLg==")  # "Hello CTF."

# XOR key from reverse engineering
key = 0x13

# Decode
decoded = ''.join(chr(b ^ key) for b in encoded)
print("Password:", decoded)
```

> **Output:**

```bash
Password: ]rr_{#RSS(
```

> **Note:** Always sanitize and isolate binaries before running or analyzing them.

# üîê Takeaways

- Simple XOR and Base64 encoding are common in beginner RE challenges.
- Tools like Ghidra, Cutter, and IDA Free help with quick binary analysis.
- Scripts are essential for decoding obfuscated logic and automating solutions.
